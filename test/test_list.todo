Write CLI:
  - Update WebsiteGenerator.generate to use new API @done
    - WebsiteGenerator.generate takes in object @done
    - No longer takes in UI @done
    - No longer outputs @done
    - No longer prompts @done
  - generator.generate - should return Promise that resolves into array of files and directries @done
  - Run method/ Coordinator @done
  - Delete Prompt WebsiteGenerator @done
  - Prompt for Site name @done
  - Prompt for Author name @done
  - Call website generator with options @done

  - Print out Directory @done
  - Print out path to index.html @done
  - print out path to JS and CSS files @done

Write Web UI:
  - Transform raw form submission into WebsiteGenerator contract
  - Calls GeneratorService with transformed input
  - Generator Service
    - Call WebsiteGenerator with user input
    - Calls ZipArchiver with file paths
    - Returns Zip file path
  - Send user zip file

Put off:
  - Parse/Validate data - not doing for now
  - Prompt for JS
  - Prompt for CSS
  - Check website options are the right keys
  - Have WebsiteGenerator.generate return file objects instead of strings

Decision:
  - We will leave coordination of the CLI in index.js
