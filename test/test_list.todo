Write CLI:
  - Update WebsiteGenerator.generate to use new API @done
    - WebsiteGenerator.generate takes in object @done
    - No longer takes in UI @done
    - No longer outputs @done
    - No longer prompts @done
  - generator.generate - should return Promise that resolves into array of files and directries @done
  - Run method/ Coordinator @done
  - Delete Prompt WebsiteGenerator @done
  - Prompt for Site name @done
  - Prompt for Author name @done
  - Call website generator with options @done

  - Print out Directory @done
  - Print out path to index.html @done
  - print out path to JS and CSS files @done

Write Web UI:
  - Instantiates GeneratorService with raw body
  - Parse the body for website configuration
  - Generator Service
    - Call WebsiteGenerator with  website configuration
    - Calls ZipArchiver with file paths
    - Save Zip to disk
    - Returns Zip file path
    - returns zip file name
    - Optional: Validate siteName is there
  - Send user zip file
    - what happens if file doesn't exist?

Put off:
  - Parse/Validate data - not doing for now
  - Prompt for JS
  - Prompt for CSS
  - Check website options are the right keys
  - Have WebsiteGenerator.generate return file objects instead of strings
  - Put off testing that sendFile is called with the right file path using "supertest"
    - Maybe use content-length?
  - How to get a path name that is not specific to a machine?
  - We implicitly require siteName but no other configuration options

Decision:
  - We will leave coordination of the CLI in index.js
  - Should CLI be in it's own directory?
